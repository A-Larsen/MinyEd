== Building

=== Mingw
In order for mingw to work well I installed the *mingw* and *make* package with chocolatey

=== shell

Installing mingw through chocolatey is the best option to get gcc up and working
and using the c windows libraries

== syntax

if there is no arguments you should put void in stead of leaving arguments empty

[source, c]
----
void
readfile(void)
{
}
----

== Other
When using the "\r\n" new line symbol for windows files, the `fread()` function
does not read files correctly. However, the linux "\n" new line symbol works
just fine. Maybe it's better to use windows "fileapi.h", when reading certain
files on windows.

== Force Killing Program

tasklist | Select-String "jae"

taskkill /pid 17320 /t /f

== Future
=== `HeapAlloc()`
It might be benifitial to use the `HeapAlloc()` function instead of malloc in
the future. It has a `HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS` which will indicate a function
failure instead of just returning *NULL*.
